## User Story

As a student, I want to use Study Buddy to create my personalized study assistant whom I can ask questions and get help with my studies. When I visit the Study Buddy website, I can create a new study room by entering a room name and creating a subject I need help with. Once I'm in the study room, I can ask Study Buddy questions related to the subject and receive helpful answers. I can also use the search and instructions page to look up information and get step-by-step instructions for solving problems. As I make progress in my studies, Study Buddy updates my Google Calendar with milestones and achievements, so I can track my progress over time. With Study Buddy, I have a personalized study companion that helps me stay on track and achieve my academic goals.
